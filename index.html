        <h2 class="journey"> Coming To America  </h2>
        <article class="text1">
            I came to the United States in 2015 to continue living with my partner Nika.
            We met 2 years earlier when she was studying in Australia. By this stage 
            we had largely exhausted her visa options for staying on, and I was ready
            to try out her home place for a while. Being a musician I found Chicago 
            hugely inspiring and energizing, and with the help of Nika's father; Gene,
            my immigration process was soon underway. Having grown up in the bureaucratic
            jungle-gym of former Soviet Uzbekistan, and being the first of his large
            family to make the move to the US; Gene was a highly accomplished immigration
            guide. Nika and I were soon wed, and life began in the States in earnest.
            In Australia I had made my living as a touring musician, but by this stage
            I was more interested in following a more <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTfKn5VtUB8eGaQm29aPivw" id="videos">creative</a></span> path. I had just released
            my <span><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6CszShHOP5wnkzGTuBWxN5?si=qi6AluKbRmmoc-eS_LYprA" id="ep">first record</a></span> and got busy on the creation of the <span><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6EQvfcntkKiIWIOBkSrjE8?si=GdYZU3aWT4-D0z3vSS0Dfw" id="album">next.</a></span> I found
            work in other areas, namely as a sound engineer and music teacher, but after
            some time found the work unsatisfying. Gig work is relentless. I was
            continually exhausted, and the sound work was beginning to damage my hearing.
            In weighing up different paths, coding seemed to make the most sense. It tickles
            my need for fastidious activity.

        <article class="text2"> 
            I'm excited to come along for the ride of how programming continues
            to shape and define the world we live in. It's exciting to know that I'll be a 
            voice amongst that progression. 
            I'm also looking forward to grounding. After all these years of the rambling 
            musician life, I'm eager to begin growing a life of stability; to ground in the 
            profession as I continue to learn and develop my skills; to ground in the States; 
            and to ground in my life with my partner and community.
